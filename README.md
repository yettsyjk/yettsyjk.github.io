## About Me
- I’m a positive, flexible, and passionate, hands-on cyber engineer who gets excited about using emerging technologies to solve difficult problems. 
- My background combines over 6 years of customer-facing experiences in the accounting industry with Java and Python software technology education. 
- I enjoy getting my hands on some CTFs (Capture The Flag) events and researching critical infrastructure opportunities. 
- I empowered to use my critical thinking skills and put myself in the customer’s shoes to provide efficient and secure solutions. I enjoy the adventure and reward of learning new skills to craft, earning trust, delivering responsive, and useful customer email API platforms at every interaction. 
- Its my pleasure to work with our fast-paced collaborative team and contribute to team growth.
